PHP 101 coursework and homework

### Week 1

We learned basic PHP syntax, including statements like `if`, built-in functions like `strlen`, and even used a special array provided by PHP called `$argv`.

Depending on your home setup, you might open the `Terminal`, change directories to the repository, and run `php content/week1/main.php Charleston`.

You should see text similar to we had in class. Try it again with a two-word city, like `San Francisco`.

There's a problem. Our script only writes `San`!

1. Why is this happening? Where did `Francisco` go?
2. Can you find a way to accept a city containing any number of words? There's more than one right answer!
